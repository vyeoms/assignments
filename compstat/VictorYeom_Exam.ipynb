    "- Justify your answers (both positive and negative) briefly.\n",
    "- For each sampler that will not converge to the correct distribution, suggest a change to fix it to converge to the intended target distribution.\n",

    "### Problem descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "In all cases, we assume we are using a Metropolis-Hastings sampler that takes three arguments: \n",
    "- the log-target density `ltarget(x)`;\n",
    "- the proposal density `eval_logq(xp, x)` evaluating $\\log q(x';x)$, i.e. the log probability of proposing $x'$ denoted by `xp` when the current state is $x$; \n",
    "- a function `sample_q(x)` to draw samples $x'$ from the proposal $q(x' ; x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that the sampler is initialized at a valid point `x0` (for which the log-target is not `-np.inf`). The sampler will take `2*n` samples, throwing away the first `n` for warmup. `n` is assumed to be a sufficiently large number to ensure convergence *if* the algorithm is correct. For some problems, the required `n` might be astronomically large, but that's fine: this problem is not asking about efficiency, but about *correctness*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following snippet of code is used to draw the samples and compute the acceptance probability:\n",
    "``` {python}\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import numpy.random as npr\n",
    "import scipy.stats as sps\n",
    "\n",
    "xp = sample_q(x)\n",
    "accrate = np.minimum(1, np.exp(ltarget(xp) + eval_logq(x, xp) - ltarget(x) - eval_logq(xp, x)))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Many samplers are based on a symmetric proposal with $q(x';x) = q(x;x')$ and define `eval_logq(xp, x) = 0`. This is OK if the proposal really is symmetric, because then `eval_logq(x, xp) == eval_logq(xp, x)`, making the corresponding terms to cancel out in the above acceptance rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Notes and hints*: \n",
    "- Since the sampler is a Metropolis-Hastings sampler, what you need to check is mostly two things: (1) whether the log-proposal pdf is implemented correctly, and (2) if the proposal would allow the chain to (eventually) explore the entire target distribution.\n",
    "- **You are not required to run any code: answering the questions and providing code for the fixed functions is enough.**\n",
    "- Still, as a way to double-check your hypotheses and answers, sometimes it can be useful for you to write code and run the proposed Metropolis-Hastings samplers on the given problems. Write this test code in a separate file, not here.\n",
    "- For example, plot a normalized histogram of the samples obtained from the MCMC run overlaid on top of the (normalized) true target pdf.\n",
    "- However, note that the problem is asking if a sampler will *eventually* converge. If the sampler would converge with an astronomically large `n`, it would still count as converging for the purpose of this question. For some problems, you might be unable to see convergence by simply running the sampler on your computer (unless you can run it for an astronomically large `n`), in which case you will have to think asymptotically. In particular, finite-time diagnostic like $\\hat{R}$ are not necessarily informative about *asymptotic* convergence.\n",
    "- Do **not** submit your test code or test plots (those are only useful checks for you). Below, only write your answer and a brief justification including, if needed, a snippet of code for what needs to be fixed."

    "Briefly justify your answers and explain how to fix the samplers that would not asymptotically converge to the correct distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In questions 1 through 4, the proposals are all symmetrical, so the samplers match their respective log probability densities.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The target distribution has a range defined in $(-\\pi, \\pi)$, but the proposal only produces samples within the interval $\\left[-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$. This means that the chain would NOT be able to explore the entire target distribution. The sampler is symmetric, so this is not something we can fix by modifying the `eval_logq1()` function, we must modify the sampler used.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be solved by expanding the range of the proposal:\n",
    "``` {python}\n",
    "    def sample_q1(x):\n",
    "        return npr.uniform(-np.pi, np.pi)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Or by centering the new sample around x:\n",
    "``` {python}\n",
    "    def sample_q1(x):\n",
    "        return x + npr.uniform(-np.pi/2, np.pi/2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Both the target and the proposal follow Student's t-distribution centered around `x-1`, with the only difference being the degrees of freedom, so the proposal covers the whole range of the target. This means that the chain will converge\n",
    "3. The target is defined in the range $(-3, -0.99)\\cup(0.99, 3)$. The proposal covers a range from `x-2` to `x+2`. So if, for example, the last sample `x` is between 0.99 and 1, it could *possibly* jump over to -1 (since $0.99-2=-1.01$), and then it is more likely that the proposal will sample in the range $(-3, -0.99)$. It can take a long while, but it will eventually converge.\n",
    "4. The target is defined in the range $(-\\infty, -25)\\cup(-20, 20)\\cup(25, +\\infty)$. The proposal is a uniform distribution of width 4 centered around x. This means that, for example if x were equal to 20, it wouldn't be able to jump to 25 as the most it could \"jump to the right\" on the real line is 2. In other words, it is not able to explore the whole range for which the target is defined. Again, the sampler is based on a symmetric distribution, so this is not something we can fix by modifying `eval_logq4()`. A simple way to fix this would to make the uniform distribution's width bigger, to a bit bigger than 10 (because numpy's uniform distribution excludes the right boundary):\n",

We get the inverse of $\\mathbf{L}$, from which we can get $\\mathbf{V}^{-1} = \\mathbf{L}^{-\\intercal}\\mathbf{L}^{-1}$.

    "An importance sampler is used, with a surrogate log-logistic or Fisk distribution. From scipy's documentation, the Fisk distribution has the PDF:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$g(x; c) = \\frac{cx^{c-1}}{(1+x^c)^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With shape parameter $c$. Notice that if we set $c=1$, we get the following PDF:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$g(x; 1) = \\frac{1}{(1+x)^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From the lecture notes, if we have a target with PDF $f(x)$, a surrogate distribution with pdf $g(x)$ and an arbitrary function $h(x)$ for which we wish to calculate the expectation, we need the following condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$g(x) = 0 \\Rightarrow h(x)f(x) = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, $g(x)$ approaches 0 only as $x\\rightarrow\\infty$, so the condition holds. It is also stated that to have low variance in the estimation, two conditions should be met:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{V}_{f} \\left[ h(X) \\right] < \\infty, \\hspace{2em} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} < M \\forall x$$\n",

    "For some $M>0$. For this exercise, we will use only the second condition as diagnostic for variance of the estimator. We have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \\frac{2}{3}e^{-2\\sqrt{x+1}+2}(1+x)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Both functions are well defined for the range $x\\in [0, +\\infty]$, and the exponential function dominates the asymptotic behavior as $x\\rightarrow\\infty$. This is confirmed through the use of Wolfram Alpha through the calculation of $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The condition for using importance sampling is met, and the diagnostic of the constant M implies that the estimator will have low variance. This justifies the correctness of the approach used. To verify the result, the ground truth of the expected value is calculated with scipy's `quad` function from the `integrate` module. Integrating over the target function, we see that the ground truth for the expected value is approximately $12.833$. The calculated value is relatively close, and the ground truth is contained within the 95% confidence interval, which validates the approach taken."

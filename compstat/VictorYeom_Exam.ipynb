    "\n",
    "In all cases, we assume we are using a Metropolis-Hastings sampler that takes three arguments: \n",
    "- the log-target density `ltarget(x)`;\n",
    "- the proposal density `eval_logq(xp, x)` evaluating $\\log q(x';x)$, i.e. the log probability of proposing $x'$ denoted by `xp` when the current state is $x$; \n",
    "- a function `sample_q(x)` to draw samples $x'$ from the proposal $q(x' ; x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that the sampler is initialized at a valid point `x0` (for which the log-target is not `-np.inf`). The sampler will take `2*n` samples, throwing away the first `n` for warmup. `n` is assumed to be a sufficiently large number to ensure convergence *if* the algorithm is correct. For some problems, the required `n` might be astronomically large, but that's fine: this problem is not asking about efficiency, but about *correctness*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following snippet of code is used to draw the samples and compute the acceptance probability:\n",
    "``` {python}\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import numpy.random as npr\n",
    "import scipy.stats as sps\n",
    "\n",
    "xp = sample_q(x)\n",
    "accrate = np.minimum(1, np.exp(ltarget(xp) + eval_logq(x, xp) - ltarget(x) - eval_logq(xp, x)))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Many samplers are based on a symmetric proposal with $q(x';x) = q(x;x')$ and define `eval_logq(xp, x) = 0`. This is OK if the proposal really is symmetric, because then `eval_logq(x, xp) == eval_logq(xp, x)`, making the corresponding terms to cancel out in the above acceptance rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Notes and hints*: \n",
    "- Since the sampler is a Metropolis-Hastings sampler, what you need to check is mostly two things: (1) whether the log-proposal pdf is implemented correctly, and (2) if the proposal would allow the chain to (eventually) explore the entire target distribution.\n",
    "- **You are not required to run any code: answering the questions and providing code for the fixed functions is enough.**\n",
    "- Still, as a way to double-check your hypotheses and answers, sometimes it can be useful for you to write code and run the proposed Metropolis-Hastings samplers on the given problems. Write this test code in a separate file, not here.\n",
    "- For example, plot a normalized histogram of the samples obtained from the MCMC run overlaid on top of the (normalized) true target pdf.\n",
    "- However, note that the problem is asking if a sampler will *eventually* converge. If the sampler would converge with an astronomically large `n`, it would still count as converging for the purpose of this question. For some problems, you might be unable to see convergence by simply running the sampler on your computer (unless you can run it for an astronomically large `n`), in which case you will have to think asymptotically. In particular, finite-time diagnostic like $\\hat{R}$ are not necessarily informative about *asymptotic* convergence.\n",
    "- Do **not** submit your test code or test plots (those are only useful checks for you). Below, only write your answer and a brief justification including, if needed, a snippet of code for what needs to be fixed."

    "\n",
    "Briefly justify your answers and explain how to fix the samplers that would not asymptotically converge to the correct distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In questions 1 through 4, the proposals are all symmetrical, so the samplers match their respective log probability densities.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The target distribution has a range defined in $(-\\pi, \\pi)$, but the proposal only produces samples within the interval $\\left[-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$. This means that the chain would NOT be able to explore the entire target distribution. The sampler is symmetric, so this is not something we can fix by modifying the `eval_logq1()` function, we must modify the sampler used.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be solved by expanding the range of the proposal:\n",
    "``` {python}\n",
    "    def sample_q1(x):\n",
    "        return npr.uniform(-np.pi, np.pi)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Or by centering the new sample around x:\n",
    "``` {python}\n",
    "    def sample_q1(x):\n",
    "        return x + npr.uniform(-np.pi/2, np.pi/2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Both the target and the proposal follow Student's t-distribution centered around `x-1`, with the only difference being the degrees of freedom, so the proposal covers the whole range of the target. This means that the chain will converge\n",
    "3. The target is defined in the range $(-3, -0.99)\\cup(0.99, 3)$. The proposal covers a range from `x-2` to `x+2`. So if, for example, the last sample `x` is between 0.99 and 1, it could *possibly* jump over to -1 (since $0.99-2=-1.01$), and then it is more likely that the proposal will sample in the range $(-3, -0.99)$. It can take a long while, but it will eventually converge.\n",
    "4. The target is defined in the range $(-\\infty, -25)\\cup(-20, 20)\\cup(25, +\\infty)$. The proposal is a uniform distribution of width 4 centered around x. This means that, for example if x were equal to 20, it wouldn't be able to jump to 25 as the most it could \"jump to the right\" on the real line is 2. In other words, it is not able to explore the whole range for which the target is defined. Again, the sampler is based on a symmetric distribution, so this is not something we can fix by modifying `eval_logq4()`. A simple way to fix this would to make the uniform distribution's width bigger, to a bit bigger than 10 (because numpy's uniform distribution excludes the right boundary):\n",
    "\n",
    "``` {python}\n",
    "    def sample_q4(x):\n",
    "        return x + npr.uniform(-5.1, 5.1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The sampler `sample_q5(x)` is defined by the subtraction of two IID random variables that follow the exponential distribution, centered around x. This is the definition of a Laplace distribution centered around x, which is known to be a symmetric distribution. The PDF used in the function `eval_logq5()` doesn't match exactly the sampler, but it evaluates a normal distribution centered around x, which is also symmetric. Therefore, since the generated samples are symmetric, they will cancel out in the evaluation of the rejection criterion. This will converge, since the target distribution is defined for $\\mathbb{R}$ and the sampler covers all $\\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The target is defined for all $\\mathbb{R}$, the modulo of the argument is well defined for all real numbers with numpy's mod function. The sampler in `sample_q6(x)` draws samples from a normal distribution centered around x with a standard deviation of `3e-2`, which covers all the reals, so it covers the range of the target. The function `eval_logq6()` evaluates the log-PDF of a normal distribution centered around x with a standard deviation of `1e-1`. Similarly to the previous point, this means that the logq's will cancel out in the evaluation of the rejection criterion, since both the PDF and the sampler are symmetric. An important thing to notice here, though, is that the target is *not normalized*, so it does not represent a true probability distribution; its integral across all $\\mathbb{R}$ does not converge. This means that for the algorithm to converge to the target, an infinite number of samples and time are needed. In practice, since computers have limited precision, the sampler will converge since there is a limit to the samples that can be produced through double precision."

    "To keep numerical stability within the sum, it is best to calculate the log of the terms to avoid issues with double precision. This can be done in a vectorized manner with numpy functions.

To verify the result, the ground truth of the expected value is calculated with scipy's `quad` function from the `integrate` module. Integrating over the target function, we see that the ground truth for the expected value is approximately $12.833$. The calculated value is relatively close, and the ground truth is contained within the 95% confidence interval, which validates the approach taken."

For this, the `skew()` function implements the formula given in the exercise for skewness, while the `bootstrap()` function performs the bootstrap sampling. This function is adapted from lecture 4; it performs `n_bootstrap` amount of estimations of the `statistic` of interest on different permutations with replacement of `data`, after which it returns the confidence interval estimated with percentiles and, if the user specifies it with `return_sample`, the sets of statistics generated from the bootstrap. Using `bootstrap(p2_data, 1000, skew)` we're calculating the 95% confidence interval of the values of `skew()` calculated from 1000 permutations of the data.\n",

An important thing to notice is that each of the 10000 sets is individual from each other, so they could have happened in any order, not just the original order estimated by the teacher. From these facts, we can follow these steps to estimate a confidence interval on the lower and upper bounds:\n",

When we permute the 10000 teacher samples, we virtually get 10 new observations that a student could have estimated, out of which we can estimate 10 new confidence intervals. We can repeat this process until we get a sufficient amount of confidence intervals to estimate the teacher confidence intervals on the lower and upper bounds, which is done with percentiles."

    "\n",
    "The target density is a mixture of $K = 4$ products of [shifted (or non-standardized) Students' t distributions](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.t.html) (each dimension of a mixture component has an independent shifted Student's t) defined as follows:\n",

    "The function `logTarget()` implements the log-target distribution as defined by the problem statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function `estimate_elbo():` calculates an estimation of the ELBO through a Monte Carlo approach. It calculates an approximation of the ELBO defined by the formula:\n",

    "\\text{ELBO}(\\psi) = \\mathbb{E}_{q_\\psi(\\theta)}\\left[ \\log p_\\text{target}(\\theta)\\right] - \\mathbb{E}_{q_\\psi(\\theta)}\\left[\\log q_\\psi(\\theta)\\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This function was taken from the solutions for lecture 11 and adapted for the 2-dimensional theta of this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `dsvi()` is taken from the solution of week 5's assignment, it implements the doubly-stochastic variational inference algorithm proposed by Titsias and Lázaro-Gredilla (2014).\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `explore_wide_range_elbo()`, serves as an exploration of a wide range of possible values for m and c to use in `dsvi()`. Since this is a gradient method, we should explore a relatively wide range of possible values for m and c so as to not get stuck in a local maximum, evaluating the maximized ELBO after running `dsvi()` at each point. To do this, we set fixed values for either m or c and calculate the maximum elbo by changing the values of the unfixed variables. This is just to get a rough view of which range of values should be used on each parameter to maximize ELBO. To make sure that the solution isn't overfitting to some local maximum, different fixed values of m and c were tested to check for the values of ELBO, with which we get values for m around `[3, 4]` and values for c around `[1, 1]`. This is a hint that the gaussian approximation is mostly wrapping around the Student T distribution of the mixture that has a mean around `[3, 4]`\n",

    "After finding the range of values for maximized ELBO, we run `dsvi()` with a finer rho around the points obtained in the previous point to fine tune the values of `m` and `c`, and then we can diagnose if they have converged by plotting their variational optimization trace. We can see that the values of standard deviation fluctuate within a band of around 0.1, which may be due to the approximation of the mixture distribution with just a normal distribution. Since the target distribution is multimodal, the standard deviation of the normal distribution being fit may be hard to estimate.\n",

    "Another visual aid was made to visually validate the fit with the function `visualize_fit()`. ). This plot gives a visual confirmation that indeed the gaussian fit is just wrapping the Student T distribution with the biggest weight in the mixture model. This is similar to what was seen in lecture 11's example with a multimodal distribution, where the gaussian fit just wrapped around one of the modes. A reason why this may happen is that the algorithm tends to underestimate variance as mentioned in chapter 12 of the lecture notes."

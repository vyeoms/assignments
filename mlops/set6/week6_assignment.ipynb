    "**Guidelines of submitting assignments**:\n",
    "- In the first assignment, you'll need to write some configurations in a YAML file, so please include the YAML file in your submission.  \n",
    "- For every remaining assignment, a code skeleton is provided. Please put your solutions in between the `### START CODE HERE` and `### END CODE HERE` code comments. \n",
    "- Some assignments also require you to capture screenshots in order to earn points. Please put all your screenshots into a single PDF file. For each screenshot, please clearly indicate which assignment it corresponds to in your PDF file. \n",
    "- When preparing your submission, be sure to include your assignment notebook with code cell outputs. It's important that these outputs are up-to-date and reflect the latest state of your code, as your grades may depend on them. Additionally, please include the PDF file that contains your screenshots in your submission. "

    "\n",
    "(If HTTP status codes are new to you, more information can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes).)\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to add an alerting rule to [manifests/prometheus-config-patch.yaml](./manifests/prometheus-config-patch.yaml) that **immediately** triggers an alert when your \"house-price\" inference service running in the \"kserve-inference\" namespace gives more than **ten** 4xx error responses in the **past one minute**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please add your alerting rule between the commands \"### START ALERTING RULE\" and \"### END ALERTING RULE\". **Please include the file \"prometheus-config-patch.yaml\" in your submission.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "- An essential part in configuring an alerting rule is to decide which PromQL query to use. It may be easier if you first test your query in the Prometheus UI [http://prometheus-server.local](http://prometheus-server.local) before writing your alerting rule to the configuration file. You can use the following code cell to send some invalid requests to your inference service, and then go to the Prometheus UI to test if your query can retrieve a reasonable value. \n",
    "- You may find the `revision_app_request_count` metric useful (introduced in the tutorial). You can then use the labels `namespace_name`, `isvc_name`, `response_code_class` to only include the responses you want to monitor. \n",
    "- You may also find the PromQL function [increase()](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/functions/#increase) useful. "

    "1. You also need to declare the `prep_report` and `prepare_regression_test` functions inside the component. These two functions work in the same way as those you created in Assignment2. The `prep_report` function produces an Evidently Report using the following Metric Presets: `RegressionPreset`, `TargetDriftPreset` and `DataDriftPreset`. The `prep_regression_test` produces an Evidently TestSuite for testing MAE (of the predictions made on the production data). You can use the `TestValueMAE` test in the TestSuite. The test should fail if the MAE is not less than 40000. An exception is that the  `prep_report` and `prepare_regression_test` functions don't accept an `column_mapping_dict` argument but use a column mapping created beforehand. \n",
    "1. Unlike the previous assignment where the reference DataFrame is directly read from a local file, this component needs to first download the reference Parquet file from the MLflow's artifact store and then loads the reference DataFrame from the downloaded Parquet file. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints**:You can use [mlflow.artifacts.download_artifacts](https://mlflow.org/docs/2.3.2/python_api/mlflow.artifacts.html#mlflow.artifacts.download_artifacts) to download the reference data. When using the method, using the `run_id` argument may be easier than `artifact_uri` as the MLflow Run ID will be passed as an input to the component. "

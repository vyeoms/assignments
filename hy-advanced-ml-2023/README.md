# DATA12001 Advanced Course in Machine Learning 

Assignments for the Advanced Machine Learning course at the University of Helsinki. The course's information is available [here](https://studies.helsinki.fi/courses/cu/hy-CU-118209233-2021-08-01/Advanced_Course_in_Machine_Learning). The learning outcomes according to the course's page:

> Obtains deeper knowledge of domain skills in machine learning: Can describe the basic formulation of machine learning as minimising the expected risk, and recognises alternative formulations for the risk. Can derive practical loss functions starting from the formal definition, and can describe the relationship between probabilistic models and loss minimisation. Can describe clearly the core tasks of unsupervised and supervised learning, and recognises also more advanced learning setups. Is able to derive and implement in a numerical programming language at least one algorithm suitable for each typical unsupervised learning task: clustering, factor analysis and dimensionality reduction. Can derive and implement in a numerical programming language sparse and regularised linear methods for classification and regression, and can implement some non-linear classification methods such as random forests and support vector machines.
